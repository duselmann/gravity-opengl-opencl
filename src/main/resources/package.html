Resource Files

package.html this file describes all files in this directory and other packages.
log4j.properties is the logging configuration.

demo/ contains resources from lwjgl demos.

cl/ dir contains many OpenCL kernel files.
	space-gravity.txt is the kernel for Space.java
	colRows2D2D.txt and sum*.* files are OpenCL kernels for the simple demos.
	gravity-cl*.* are used in (or are versions of) the advanced OpenCL demo files.
	const.txt is used by the CLUtils to convert return codes to strings.
	nvidiaNBody-cl.txt is an NVidia demo file that also implements gravity but not how I wanted.
		I used this file to understand the nuance passing data to OpenCL kernels.
		
gl/ dir contains many OpenGL shader files.
	space-points.* are shaders for the Space.java application.
	gl4points.*    are shaders from my sandbox OpenGL testing.
	points.* are some alternate shaders that I might use.
